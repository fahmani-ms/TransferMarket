    "### Goal Difference Efficiency (GDE)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Goal Difference Efficiency (GDE) is a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) used to evaluate the performance of football teams based on their goal-scoring ability and defensive record. It provides insights into the relative strength of a team's attack compared to their defense.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDE is calculated using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "GDE = Goals Scored / Goals Conceded\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "A higher GDE value indicates a stronger attacking performance relative to defensive capabilities. It suggests that the team is effective at scoring goals while maintaining a solid defensive record. On the other hand, a lower GDE value signifies weaker attackers and potentially stronger defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Application\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the GDE values of different teams, you can identify those with a higher ratio of goals scored to goals conceded, highlighting their strong attacking prowess. Conversely, teams with a lower GDE are likely to have weaker attackers and potentially stronger defenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that while GDE provides a useful initial indicator of a team's attacking and defensive strengths, it should be considered alongside other factors for a comprehensive evaluation of their overall performance."
